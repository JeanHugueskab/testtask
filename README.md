HeyJobs Integrations Test Task

for the coding challenge of Heyjobs I built this nodejs app who fetch 100 jokes from the Chuck Norris API.
in order to fetch those jokes you have to run : Nodejs index.js
I also commented my code in order to explain what was my logic behind the pieces of code that I wrote.
