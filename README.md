# Test_task

    for the coding challenge of Heyjobs I built this nodejs app using the framework express, who fetch 100 jokes from the Chuck Norris API.
    in order to fetch those jokes you have to run : Nodejs index.js
    I also commented my code in order to explain what was my logic behind the pieces of code that I wrote.
